\arguments{
\item{name}{String for clonal line name.}

\item{alate_b0}{The proportion of offspring from apterous aphids is
\code{inv_logit(alate_b0 + alate_b1 * N)} where \code{N} is the total number of
aphids in that field.
Defaults to \code{-5}.}

\item{alate_b1}{The proportion of offspring from apterous aphids is
\code{inv_logit(alate_b0 + alate_b1 * N)} where \code{N} is the total number of
aphids in that field.
Defaults to \code{0.0022}, which makes alate production only mildly
density dependent.}

\item{distr_0}{A 2-column matrix indicating the starting stage distribution.
(The total abundance of aphids is adjusted in the simulation function.)
If \code{NULL}, there will be no starting alates and apterous densities
will follow the stable age distribution.
If a matrix, it must have 5 rows (rows indicate instar)
or a row per aphid age (rows indicate age in days).
Matrix column indicates apterous vs alate.
The matrix will be coerced to sum to 1.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{resistant}{Logical or vector of survivals of
singly attacked and multiply attacked aphids.
If a logical, \code{FALSE} is equivalent to \code{c(0,0)} and results in no
resistance.
\code{TRUE} results in the resistance values for a resistance line
from unpublished work by Anthony Ives.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{surv_juv_apterous}{A single number for the juvenile survival rate for
apterous aphids. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which results in estimates
from a medium-reproduction line.}

\item{surv_adult_apterous}{A vector of adult survival probabilities for
apterous aphids. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which results in estimates
from a medium-reproduction line.}

\item{repro_apterous}{A vector of fecundities for for apterous aphids.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, which results in estimates from a
medium-reproduction line.}

\item{surv_juv_alates}{A single number for the juvenile survival rate for
alates aphids. Defaults to \code{"low"}, which results in estimates
from a low-reproduction line.}

\item{surv_adult_alates}{A vector of adult survival probabilities for
alates aphids. Defaults to \code{"low"}, which results in estimates
from a low-reproduction line.}

\item{repro_alates}{A vector of fecundities for for alates aphids.
Defaults to \code{"low"}, which results in estimates from a low-reproduction
line.}

\item{surv_paras}{A single number for the juvenile survival rate for
parasitized aphids.
Because parasitized aphids don't make it to adulthood, this is the only
survival rate necessary.
Defaults to \code{"low"}, which results in estimates from a
low-reproduction line.}

\item{temp}{Single string specifying \code{"low"} (20ยบ C) or \code{"high"} (27ยบ C)
temperature. Defaults to \code{"low"}.}

\item{p_instar_smooth}{A value greater than zero here makes not all 4th
instar aphids go to the adult stage at the same time.
Of the 4th instars that would've moved to adulthood, \code{p_instar_smooth}
remain as 4th instars.
To keep the growth rate approximately equal, for the aphids that
would've transitioned to 4th instar, \code{p_instar_smooth} move to
adulthood instead.
Defaults to \code{0.5}.}

\item{sigma_x}{Standard deviation of environmental stochasticity for aphids.
This argument has no effect if used in simulations with no environmental
error (i.e., when \code{environ_error = FALSE}).
Defaults to the internal object \code{environ$sigma_x},
which is from Meisner et al. (2014).}

\item{rho}{Environmental correlation among instars.
This argument has no effect if used in simulations with no environmental
error (i.e., when \code{environ_error = FALSE}).
Defaults to \code{environ$rho}.}
}
\value{
A list with the necessary info to pass onto \code{all_fields}.
}
\description{
To smooth stage structure out over time,
not all 4th instar aphids move to adulthood immediately.
If adulthood starts on day \code{t}, then half of aphids at age \code{t-2} move to
adulthood, and half at age \code{t-1} do, too.
I adjusted age \code{t-2}, too, to avoid this affecting the growth rate too much.
